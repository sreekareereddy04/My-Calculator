## 🔑 How It Works

- **DOM Manipulation:** Each calculator button has an associated data-value and event listener to update the display.
- **Event Handling:** Click and keyboard events are captured and routed to corresponding actions (e.g., input, calculate, clear).
- **Expression Evaluation:** Uses `eval()` with safeguards to parse and compute results dynamically.
- **UI/UX:** Neon-glow buttons, custom fonts, and smooth transitions ensure a modern look and feel.
